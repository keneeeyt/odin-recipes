        <li>2 pounds pig face (snouts, ears, and jowls)</li>
        <li>1 cup vinegar</li>

        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>1 large onion, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>6 Thai chili peppers, stemmed and minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup calamansi juice</li>

        <li>1/2 cup liver spread</li>
        <li>pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Recipe instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, combine pig face, vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, peppercorns, bay leaves, about 1 tablespoon salt,  and enough water to completely cover pork. </li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, skimming scum that floats on top. Lower heat, cover, and simmer for about 50 minutes to 1 hour or until meat is tender. Remove from heat and drain well, discarding liquid.</li>
        <li>Over a hot grill, grill pork for about 7 to 10 minutes on each side or until crisp and slightly charred. Or arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet and broil in a 450 F oven for about 4 to 5 minutes or until nicely charred. </li>
        <li>Remove from heat, allow to cool to touch, and chop meat.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine chopped meat, onions, chili peppers, calamansi juice., and liquid seasoning. </li>
        <li>And liver spread and gently stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>To serve, transfer to sizzling hot plates. </li>
    </ol>
